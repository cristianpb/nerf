If you didn't know already, Nerf was first introduced by Hasbro, Inc., in 1969, and has since become a household name. Originally designed as a soft foam material for use in soccer balls, the company soon realized the potential of this innovative product in creating safe yet fun blasters and sports equipment. In fact, the NERF brand is now synonymous with active playtime, family bonding, and friendly competitions among friends!

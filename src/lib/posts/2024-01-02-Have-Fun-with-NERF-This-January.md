January is a cold month, but it's also the perfect time to stay active and warm up with your favorite blasters from the NERF arsenal! Here are some fun ways to celebrate January with NERF:

## Winter Nerf Wars
Do you and your friends love getting together for epic NERF battles? Why not take it outside this winter? Grab your long-range blasters, like the NERF N-STRIKE Elite Stampede ECS-50 Blaster, and play a round of Winter NERF Wars. This event is best played in the snow or on a cold day where everyone can bundle up and dodge winter weather while trying to take each other out with foam darts!

## NERF Family Fun Night

Sometimes, getting together as a family is just what you need to warm your heart during these cold months. Set up the living room with obstacles or use a small outdoor space, then pick up some official NERF sport Blasters like the NERF RIVAL Phantom Corps Zeus MXVII-1000 Blaster and invite the whole family for an evening of friendly competition!

## Create DIY Nerf Mods & Accessories
Do you consider yourself a NERF enthusiast? Take some time in January to get crafty and create new mods, add-ons or accessories for your blasters. Check out online tutorials for creative ideas or let your imagination run wild! This is a great way to stay indoors and warm while honing your DIY skills.

## Celebrate NERF Day (January 25th)
Every year on January 25th, fans around the world celebrate National NERF Day! Mark this special day by organizing a large-scale NERF battle with friends and family. Plan ahead by choosing a fun location like a park or an indoor arena, set up rules for safe play, and make it an unforgettable event.

January can be a dreary month, but with these NERF ideas, you're sure to have tons of fun and stay warm at the same time! Get your blasters ready and enjoy these chilly months with Nerf.

We know it's been a long, cold winter, but fear not! It's almost time to say goodbye to the chilly season and welcome the warmth of spring. But first, let's take a moment to celebrate what we love about winter with some awesome NERF fun! Here are some of our favorite events happening around this time:

## National Pizza Day - February 9
Who doesn't love pizza? And what better way to spend a winter evening than enjoying a delicious pie while playing with your favorite NERF gear. You could even have a pizza party with all your friends and enjoy the ultimate NERF showdown!

## Groundhog Day - February 2
Whether you believe in the prognostications of our furry friends or not, Groundhog Day is a great opportunity to get outside, have some fun, and celebrate winter before it's too late. Set up a NERF target for your little groundhogs to chase and shoot at!

## Winter Olympics - February 4-20 (usually)
The Winter Olympics are always a treat to watch and a great reminder of the exciting activities and sports that can be played in winter weather. Join in on the fun with your NERF gear or use it as inspiration for backyard games! You never know, maybe the next Winter Olympian will start off with some NERF practice.

## Valentine's Day - February 14
If you're looking to share the love this winter, why not combine it with a little NERF game? Set up targets that spell out "BE MINE" or create your very own heart-shaped target - the possibilities are endless! This way, you can show your affection while having some friendly competition.

So there you have it â€“ plenty of ways to enjoy winter and make the most out of all that snow and cold weather with NERF! Don't let the season get you down; celebrate winter in your own fun-filled way.

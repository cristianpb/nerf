March 8th is a special day - it is [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/About), a global celebration of the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women. On this day, we honor the incredible power and resilience of women worldwide and highlight their contributions to society.

NERF, that iconic brand known for its innovative foam-dart blasters and sports equipment, is also joining in on the celebration. How, you ask?

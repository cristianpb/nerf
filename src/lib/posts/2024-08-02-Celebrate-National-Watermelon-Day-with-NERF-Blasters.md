2. **NERF N-Strike Elite Retaliator Blaster**: With this Retaliator blaster, you can customize your experience by adding different barrels, darts, and accessories! It's easy to use and can fire up to 90 feet (27 meters) with darts. Imagine how far a water balloon would fly!
   
3. **NERF Ultra One Motorized Blaster**: This motorized blaster is perfect for those who want an automatic, fast-firing option. Fire up to eight rounds per second and maintain control on the battlefield. It comes with 20 High-Impact (HI) darts, but think about swapping them out for some water balloons!

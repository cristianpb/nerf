## 3. NERF-Themed Snow Sculptures

This unofficial holiday falls right in the middle of winter, and what better way to celebrate than with a NERF-inspired twist? Fill up some clear pipettes with water and press them onto bubble wrap for an exhilarating pop-filled experience. Challenge yourself or your friends to see who can pop the most bubbles using only their blasters!

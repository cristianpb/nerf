### March Month: Spring Cleaning BlastTagÂ® Game
Who doesn't love a clean home? Use this season as an opportunity to engage children in spring cleaning while having fun simultaneously! The objective of this game is to get all your household chores done before the buzzer goes off, just like a real-life NERF version of "The Floor is Lava".

### March 20th: First Day of Spring
This day represents the official start of spring. Have fun with the NERF Sport line of products such as balls, hockey sticks or even try basketball or football. A perfect time to get active and celebrate the new season!

## **ðŸŽ® NERF Video Game Frenzy:**
For those cozy rainy days, why not have a Nerf video game marathon where you can enjoy all of your favorite Nerf characters in the digital world. From Nerf N-Strike Elite to Zombie Strike, relive moments of fun and excitement while enjoying the comfort of home!

Don't forget to share your experiences, pictures or videos about your Spring with NERF this year on social media using #SpringWithNERF hashtag. Spread the joy, encourage others to get outdoors, be active and continue the celebration all year round! 

Remember that NERF products are designed for ages 6+. However, for younger siblings or friends joining the fun, we recommend adult supervision. Happy Spring from your friendly neighborhood NERF enthusiasts!

üîã Did you know that **February 19th** is recognized as [National Battery Day](https://www.nationaldaycalendar.com/national-battery-day-february-19/) in the United States? Since our NERF toys run on batteries, we thought this would be a great opportunity for us to come together and celebrate!

### Why do we celebrate National Battery Day?

* **Invention:** The batteries we use today were first invented over 200 years ago. From the early days of [voltaic piles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaic_pile) to the AA and AAA batteries we have now, batteries have certainly come a long way!
* **Essential tool:** Batteries power not just our NERF blasters but also other important devices such as medical equipment, cars, and even spacecraft. Without them, life would be vastly different!

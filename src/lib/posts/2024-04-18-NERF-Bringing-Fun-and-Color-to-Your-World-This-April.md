Use the opportunity to teach your kids about environmental conservation while you embrace the outdoors with your NERF gear!

## **Teacher Appreciation Week (April 19-23)**
NERF has always been a strong advocate for education and learning through fun activities. Teachers often go above and beyond to engage their students in various ways, making this profession one of the most appreciated. As we celebrate Teacher Appreciation Week, NERF wants to extend its heartfelt thanks by offering discounts on some of its educational products such as NERF STEM toys and learning-centric equipment.

## **International Days Celebrated in April**
April is not short on International days worth celebrating! Among them, we have World Health Day (April 7), International Day of Sport for Development and Peace (April 6), and International Juggler's Day (April 19). NERF encourages you to engage in sports or activities that promote health, peace, and overall wellness throughout the month. Get those hearts pumping and join the fun by including NERF blasters and equipment into your event!

As we wrap up our journey through April with these exciting events, one thing is clear - NERF continues to provide endless opportunities for everyone to have a great time while promoting health, education, conservation, and love within families and communities. Don't let April end without getting your NERF game on!

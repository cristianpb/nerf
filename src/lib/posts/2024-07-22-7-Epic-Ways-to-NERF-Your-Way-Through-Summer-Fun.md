4. **Water Wars:** Combine two summer favorites: water balloons and NERF foam darts by creating a full-on water battle. Fill some of your NERF balls with water and see who can get their opponents soaked while staying dry themselves.
5. **NERF-A-Palooza:** Host an ultimate NERF festival by enlisting neighborhood friends and family to participate in various NERF games such as the "Dodge Ball Relay Race," "Human Foosball" and "The Floor is Lava."
6. **Family Game Night:** On a rainy summer day, turn your living room into a NERF bonanza by creating obstacles to dart through or setting up targets for everyone to shoot at. Make it competitive with different skill levels for both kids and adults alike.
7. **Summer Camp NERF Challenge:** Recreate the classic summer camp experience at home complete with a day-long NERF challenge course. Set up different obstacle courses, including "NERF Tug of War," "Mystery NERF Ball" and "Human Duck Duck Goose."

Get ready to NERF your way through the summer with these exciting activities while making lasting memories!

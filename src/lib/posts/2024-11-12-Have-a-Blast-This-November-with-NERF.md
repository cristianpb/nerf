To help you make the most out of this exciting time, NERF is offering a delightful range of products perfect for unleashing your inner child. Get ready to have a ball with these fantastic activities:

## ☑ Host a NERF Battle Royale

Gather your family, friends, and neighbors for an epic NERF battle royale! Pick your team colors, strategize, and dominate the playing field with our amazing selection of blasters, foam darts, and balls. You'll find something to suit your fighting style - from rapid-fire blasters like the [Rival Phantom Corps](https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/brand-families/nerf) to precision-shooting favorites such as the [N-Strike Elite](https://www.hasbro.com/en-us/brand-families/nerf/) line-up.

Make sure to follow these NERF safety tips:

1. Always wear eye protection while playing, even if you think your blaster is harmless. It's better to be safe than sorry!
2. Set boundaries for the battleground - this way, everyone knows where they can and cannot shoot.
3. Keep an eye on younger players and ensure that they are using age-appropriate blasters and foam ammunition.

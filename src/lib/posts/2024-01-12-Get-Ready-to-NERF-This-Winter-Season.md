## **January 12th - National Make Your Dreams Come True Day**

We all have our dreams, but sometimes we need a reminder to chase them. Let NERF be that motivation. Dress up in your favorite team's colors or gear (NERF products only!), and spend the day shooting some hoops or tackling each other with NERF blasters. Who knows? This might just inspire you to pursue your wildest dreams!

## **January 16th-22nd - National Puppy Week**

NERF loves puppies, and we bet you do too! During National Puppy Week, join in on the fun by posting pictures of your furry friends playing with their favorite NERF toys on social media using #NERFPuppyWeek. As a special treat, you might just win some exclusive NERF goodies for your beloved pup!
